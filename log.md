# 100 Days Of Code - Log
[Link to my Apex notes and resources list:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11q7dOthSrdU_LO_Gb22XEtDIs9BikWfwWKl1DDbcbmE/edit#)
Look this up when done with april coding challenge: [subflow that turns format from multiselect picklist to reg picklist](https://salesforcesidekick.com/2016/11/07/parse-a-multi-select-value-in-visual-flow-unmanaged-package-included/)



### R1D10 4/27/21
* Finished all my [pseudocode](https://github.com/Cpopsays/RADWomenApril2021/tree/main) for @RADWomenCode April coding challenge. 
* I have a TODO list and plan for the code. Need to get crackin' if I'm to make the deadline.
* I've already started sleeping through my alarm clock again and I will need to stop doing that so I have enough time to ft in my Platform App Builder study AND the coding practice. 
 
 ### R1D9 4/26/21
1. Watched Trailhead Live [Preparing for our Platform Developer 1 exam](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/live/broadcasts/a2r3k000001vCtQ/preparing-for-your-platform-developer-i-certification--deployment-environments-and-tools)
2. Created some anki flashcards on the material to continue to review and to research further the unfamiliar concepts


### R1D7 & 8 
* Added a few more records for monthly coding challenge  

### R1D5 & 6
* Completed [Data Creation for RAD April Challenge] (https://github.com/Cpopsays/RADWomenApril2021/blob/main/Data%20Creation)

### R1D4 Had an interesting discussion with my brother who is a software engineer at the Genomics Institute at UC Santa Cruz about how he approaches new coding problems. We discussed the RAD Women monthly coding challenge for April and how we could employ "defensive coding" strategies to ensure that our code could scale with evolving business processes. 

### R1D2-3 4/16/21-4/17/21
1. Started [Apex Basics & Database](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/apex_database)
2. Watched [Salesforece Developer Beginner - Getting Started with Apex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gY9EBvFcFQ&list=PLy4r7dYHL5VdqoRUgVa_pO95uElwGaxkp)
3. Read [The Ultimate Guide to Salesforce Flows](https://kicksaw.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-salesforce-flows/)

### R1D1 4/15/21
1. Read through the RAD Women Code April challenge, looked up unfamiliar concepts in Salesforce Developer Documentation.
2. I read about logicless Apex trigger handler structure. 
3. Studied "Salesforce Fundamentals" section of Platform App Builder Exam and chose an exam date (5/22/21)

### R1D0 4/14/21
I will resume the 100 days of code challenge on April 15th, 2021. Got off my routine for a little over one week. Decided to start over rather than resume from day 14. I'll only post daily updates on Twitter, with occasional posts to LinkedIn, and I will be following a more structured plan:

* I will complete this one hour of professional development in the morning **before I start work for the day.**
* Get up when alarm clock goes off
* 30 minutes coding or related topic.
* 30 minutes preparing for Platform App builder exam. 

The discipline required to follow a structured learning routine for 100 days - very reasonable goal of 1 hour a day - I will be capable of tackling bigger goals in the future that require greater levels of discipline, structure, and focus. 

### R1D14 April 5, 2021
